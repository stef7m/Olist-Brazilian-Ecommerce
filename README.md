## Tools
For this project, the following tools were used:
- pandas - for data analysis
- matplotlib - for visualisations
- seaborn - for visualisations
- folium - for leaftet maps
- sklearn - for machine learning and statistical modeling
- statsmodels - for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration

## Objective
To confirm or reject the following hypotheses & discover if there are any other correlations in order to built a predictive model.

## Hypotheses
1. Sales Prediction: based on purchase date information to predict future sales
2. Product Performance: if more product images means better sales and higher product items

## Dataset
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.
